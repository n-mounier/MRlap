Description: MR estimates can be subject to different types of biases due to the overlap between the exposure and outcome samples, the use of weak instruments and Winnerâ€™s curse. Our approach simultaneously accounts and corrects for all these biases, using cross-trait LD-score regression (LDSC) to approximate the overlap. It requires only GWAS summary statistics. Estimating the corrected effect using our approach can be performed as a sensitivity analysis: if the corrected effect do not significantly differ from the observed effect, then IVW-MR estimate can be safely used. However, when there is a significant difference, corrected effects should be preferred as they should be less biased, independently of the sample overlap.
