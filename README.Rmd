:information\_source: `MRlap` is still under active development. 

## Overview
[//]:*******

`MRlap` is an R-package to perform two-sample Mendelian Randomisation (MR) analyses using (potentially) overlapping samples, relying only on GWAS summary statistics. MR estimates can be subject to different types of biases due to the overlap between the exposure and outcome samples, the use of weak instruments and Winner’s curse. Our approach simultaneously accounts and corrects for all these biases. Estimating the corrected effect using our approach can be performed as a sensitivity analysis: if the corrected effect do not significantly differ from the observed effect, then IVW-MR estimate can be safely used. However, when there is a significant difference, corrected effects should be preferred as they should be less biased, independently of the sample overlap.       
This package builds up on the [`GenomicSEM`](https://github.com/GenomicSEM/GenomicSEM/) R-package to perform cross-trait LD-score regression (LDSC) and the [`TwoSampleMR`](https://github.com/MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR/) R-package for inverse-variance weighted (IVW-)MR analysis (and instruments pruning).


There is only one function available:  

-   **`MRlap()`**  
main function that performs LDSC, IVW-MR analysis and provides a corrected causal effect estimate.

More details about its usage can be found in the [manual](doc/MRlap-manual.pdf).


## Installation
[//]:*******

You can install the current version of `MRlap` with:    
```{r install-package, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Directly install the package from github
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("n-mounier/MRlap")
library(MRlap)
```
<!--- Note: using remotes instead of devtools leads to re-build the package
and apparently, it may be a problem with R 3.4 and macOS, 
see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43595457/alternate-compiler-for-installing-r-packages-clang-error-unsupported-option/43943631#43943631 --->

## Usage
[//]:*******

To run the analysis with `MRlap` different inputs are needed:


#### 1. The exposure and outcome GWAS summary statistics (`exposure` & `outcome`):
Can be a regular (space/tab/comma-separated) file or a gzipped file (.gz) or a `data.frame`. Must contain the following columns, which can have alternative names (not case sensitive):  
<ul>   SNP-identifier:  `rs` or `rsid`, `snp`, `snpid`, `rnpid`     
       Alternate (effect) allele:  `a1` or `alt`, `alts`    
       Reference allele: `a2` or `a0`, `ref`    
       Z-statistics: `Z` or `zscore`   
       Sample size: `N`</ul>     
If the Z-statistics is not present, it will be automatically calculated from effect size and standard error, in which case the following columns should be provided:     
<ul>   Effect-size: `b` or `beta`, `beta1`    
       Standard error:  `se` or `std`     </ul>     
   
#### 2. The input files for LDSC (`ld` & `hm3`):
These are needed by the [`GenomicSEM`](https://github.com/GenomicSEM/GenomicSEM/) R-package.   

- ld:   

> Expects LD scores formated as required by the original LD score regression software. Weights for the european population can be obtained by downloading the eur_w_ld_chr folder in the link below (Note that these are the same weights provided by the original developers of LDSC): https://utexas.box.com/s/vkd36n197m8klbaio3yzoxsee6sxo11v    

- hm3:   

> We suggest using an (UNZIPPED) file of HAPMAP3 SNPs with some basic cleaning applied (e.g., MHC region removed) that is supplied and created by the original LD score regression developers and available here: https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/w_hm3.snplist.bz2


### Analysis
[//]:-------------------------------

- **Example A**

```{r exampleA, eval=F}
# Using simulated exposure/outcome data 
# ~100K samples for BMI/SBP, with 0% of sample overlap 
# (only weak-instrument bias and Winner's curse)
# (1,150,000 SNPs - stored in gzipped files)
BMI <- system.file("data/", "BMI_Data.tsv.gz", package="MRlap")
SBP <- system.file("data/", "SBP_Data.tsv.gz", package="MRlap")

A = MRlap(exposure = SmallExposure_Data,
          exposure_name = "simulated_exposure",
          outcome = SmallOutcome_Data,
          outcome_name = "simulated_outcome",
          ld = "~/eur_w_ld_chr",
          hm3 = "~/w_hm3.noMHC.snplist")
# MR instruments will be selected using default parameter (5e-8) and distance-pruned (500Kb),

##### Aditionnaly, if `save_logfiles=TRUE`, LDSC log files are created in the current working directory :
-   **<exposure_name>.log** - exposure cleaning/munging log file   
-   **<outcome_name>.log** - outcome cleaning/munging log file   
-   **<exposure_name>.sumstats.gz_<outcome_name>.sumstats.gzldsc.log** - cross-trait LDSC log file


- **Example A**
```{r resultsA}
# structure of the results
str(A)
# MR + correction
unlist(A[["MRcorrection"]])
```

- **Example B**
```{r resultsB}
# observed effect
B[["MRcorrection"]]$observed_effect
# corrected effect
B[["MRcorrection"]]$corrected_effect
# difference p-value
B[["MRcorrection"]]$p_difference

# LDSC results
unlist(B[["LDSC"]])
```

## Runtime
[//]:*******

Example A ~ 4 minutes 30 seconds   

Example B ~ 3 minutes 40 seconds   

The runtime can be influenced by the size of the summary statistics files, the approach used for pruning (distance vs LD) but also by `s`, the number of simulations used for the sampling strategy to estimate the variance of the corrected causal effect and the covariance between observed and corrected effects. However, reducing the value of `s` is strongly discouraged as it can lead to an innacurate estimation of the corrected effect standard error.
